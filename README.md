## Projects
1. stacks and queues - This program implements stacks and queues using signly linked lists. The user specifies an input text file with specificially formatted commands and the program lists all of the operations completed. 

2. sorting - This program implements three sorting algorithms to sort a variety of provided datasets.  The first sort utilized a custom comparsion function in c++'s std::sort to sort two datasets.  The data sets contained 100,000 and 1,000,000 data objects respectively, consisting of random floating point numbers 40 digits long. The second sort implemented was counting sort, which efficiently sorted a dataset with 1,000,000 "short strings".  The final sort was insertion sort and it was used to sort a list of 1,000,000 objects in close-to-sorted order.
